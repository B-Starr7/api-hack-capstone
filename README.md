This is my asynchronous API web application, which combines the API's of Google Maps and Ticketmaster. The user is able to enter a city and an event they would like to see such as a musical artist or genre, or for comedy shows, etc. 

The app displays both a list of ticket links for up to 20 events in the area in ascending order of date, i.e. the events happening the soonest are at the top of the list, as well as a Map of up to 20 pins that the user can click on, which shows the name of the venue, the address, the date, and a link to the website to purchase tickets.
